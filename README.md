# Baseball Analytics
Gabby, Clark, Charlie, and John

We attempt to tell the story of how baseball has changed over time. We gathered our data from Sean Lahman's database, availabe at http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ . From there, we created visualizations in plotly.js and ggplot2 in R to demonstrate the changes in trends over time in Major League Baseball.
